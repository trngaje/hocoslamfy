hocoslamfy, ported for miyoomini

You are a small bee and you must fly to avoid the bamboo shoots!

This game requires SDL 1.2, SDL-image 1.2, SDL-mixer 1.2 and a C compiler. It is optimised for low-resolution screens.

Everything's under the GPL version 2.

To compile this for PC, use `make clean; make` on a PC with SDL, SDL-image and SDL-mixer 1.2. You'll then get a windowed SDL game.

To compile this for miyoomini, use `make platform=miyoomini` on a PC.
